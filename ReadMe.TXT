Welcome to the source code files for the Web Matrix Developer's Guide. Contained within this ZIP file are all of the examples in the book, plus the additional template creation example provided on the Web site as a bonus for the book. I have taken every precaution to ensure the source code is complete and works as explained in the book. If you ever have any problems making the source code work, please contact me at JMueller@mwt.net. In the mean time, I hope you enjoy the source code and find it helpful.

To use this source code, unZIP the file on your local hard drive. The source code is organized by chapter and each example has the unique name that I provided in the chapter. Make sure you copy any files that are designed for server use (as explained in the book) to your server. The book will also explain any other procedures you have to perform with the source code files to ensure the examples will work as anticipated. For example, when working with database examples, you'll use the source code files to create the database structure and content.

In some cases, you'll need to change the name of a server in the source code to match your system configuration. I normally explain this requirement in the book. For the most part, this is the only change that you'll need to make in order to ensure the source code will work on your system. If there are any other small changes, you'll find them listed in the appropriate chapter of the book.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make the source code easier to use or understand in the future.
