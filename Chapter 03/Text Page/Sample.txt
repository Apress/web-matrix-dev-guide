A simple text file can contain a lot of content in a small amount 
of space. You don't have to worry about accessibility problems for 
the most part, because text files don't contain anything that 
could cause a screen reader to fail. This type of content also 
works with any browser on any platform. In short, if you want to 
provide content to the largest group of people possible, a text 
file can't fail--at least in theory.

    The biggest problem with text files is that you can't format 
the information. It's in text and that's it. Sure, you can add a 
little indention and add double spaces between paragraphs, but 
that's about it. Consequently, text files aren't the glamour 
solution to anyone's data presentation needs. You'll find them 
used by some Web sites--notably educational, governmental, or 
standards organizations, but they aren't used often anywhere else.

    Even if text files aren't popular, Web Matrix provides support 
for them. You'll find the Text File template in the (General) 
category. When you create this template, all you need to supply is 
a filename. Click OK and you'll see a new text file on screen.
